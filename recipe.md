Heat a pot of saltwater big enough to accommodate your cooked pasta plus an inch or two of pasta water (for a pound of pasta, you'll want four quarts).
When it's boiling (you'll see big bubbles in the water and steam rising from the pot), add your pasta.
After it comes to a boil again, set a timer to the minutes specified on the pasta box, adjusting the flame downward if it begins boiling over, which sometimes happens.
When the timer goes off, drain and rinse the pasta in cool water to stop the cooking process.
